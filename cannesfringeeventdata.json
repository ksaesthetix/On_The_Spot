We celebrate women (rightfully), call out toxic masculinity (because it still exists), and keep returning to the same language around empowerment that once felt bold, but now feels safe.This panel challenges the familiar empowerment script in the ad industry and opens the door to a more honest, more complete conversation about gender dynamics in the ecosystem of brands, agencies, platforms and vendors. It's not about swinging the pendulum or shaming anyone—it’s about expanding the conversation to include healthier expressions of both masculinity and femininity, so everyone can show up with more intention, more clarity, and more impact.

This season-long initiative spun an intricate web between Uber Eats, the NFL and all the unexpected food references hidden within the game, to create one of the funniest, and *dumbest* conspiracies of the year. Together, we will discuss the unique cultural insights that sparked the inventive campaign, revealing how the convergence of football and food references opened new avenues for both engagement and sales, and culminated in a unique crescendo for the brand at Super Bowl LIX. With humor at its core, the campaign turned what could have been a clever retail ecosystem into a fully integrated brand idea, that kept viewers engaged with both the brand and the app through the season.",

At the same time, AI is transitioning from headline concept into practical advantage, enabling powerful efficiencies for advertisers that can protect against these headwinds. This panel explores how location intelligence—supercharged by AI—offers a more resilient alternative that goes beyond IDs: one that unites physical and digital behavior to build richer, more dynamic audiences. This results in smarter, more intent-based campaigns that adapt across environments, whether IDs are present or not. We’ll unpack how this shift enables unified audience planning, cross-screen optimization, and real-world measurement to better reflect how people actually live and predict future behavior.
