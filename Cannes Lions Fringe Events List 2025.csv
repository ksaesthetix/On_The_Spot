14.45 - 15.30,Empower Café,What Does Healthy Masculinity Look Like in the Ad Industry?,"And why the post-Mad Men chapter depends on making space for it.The gender conversation in our industry has come a long way, but lately it’s started to feel a little... predictable. We celebrate women (rightfully), call out toxic masculinity (because it still exists), and keep returning to the same language around empowerment that once felt bold, but now feels safe.This panel challenges the familiar empowerment script in the ad industry and opens the door to a more honest, more complete conversation about gender dynamics in the ecosystem of brands, agencies, platforms and vendors. It's not about swinging the pendulum or shaming anyone—it’s about expanding the conversation to include healthier expressions of both masculinity and femininity, so everyone can show up with more intention, more clarity, and more impact.

This season-long initiative spun an intricate web between Uber Eats, the NFL and all the unexpected food references hidden within the game, to create one of the funniest, and *dumbest* conspiracies of the year. Together, we will discuss the unique cultural insights that sparked the inventive campaign, revealing how the convergence of football and food references opened new avenues for both engagement and sales, and culminated in a unique crescendo for the brand at Super Bowl LIX. With humor at its core, the campaign turned what could have been a clever retail ecosystem into a fully integrated brand idea, that kept viewers engaged with both the brand and the app through the season.",Fireside Chat,https://company.givsly.com/2025-cannes-lions-givsly-hub/,https://company.givsly.com/2025-cannes-lions-givsly-hub/,"7 Bd de la Croisette,
