We celebrate women (rightfully), call out toxic masculinity (because it still exists), and keep returning to the same language around empowerment that once felt bold, but now feels safe.This panel challenges the familiar empowerment script in the ad industry and opens the door to a more honest, more complete conversation about gender dynamics in the ecosystem of brands, agencies, platforms and vendors. It's not about swinging the pendulum or shaming anyone—it’s about expanding the conversation to include healthier expressions of both masculinity and femininity, so everyone can show up with more intention, more clarity, and more impact.
